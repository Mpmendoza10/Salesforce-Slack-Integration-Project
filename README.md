<h2>Description</h2>
Working with MTBF Consulting clients come to us to resolve business issues such as this one. The client had grown from a very small firm and has employees working across multiple locations, it put a strain on communication. Slack, a collaboration and communication tool, comes in as a way to help colleagues collaborate. As a Salesforce Administrator, we will need to assist in helping our clients integrate Slack into their Salesforce ecosystem.
